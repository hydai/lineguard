# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues identified in code review comments regarding ineffective tests and misleading test implementations. The current test suite contains tests that only verify functions don't panic without asserting actual behavior, tests with misleading names that don't match their implementation, and tests with unused code. These issues provide a false sense of security and reduce the effectiveness of the test suite.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test functions to verify actual behavior and output, so that I can trust the test results and catch real bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test is written for output functions THEN the test SHALL capture and assert the actual output content
2. WHEN a test is written for reporter functions THEN the test SHALL verify the correct format and structure of the output
3. WHEN a test checks JSON output THEN the test SHALL parse and validate the JSON structure and values
4. WHEN a test checks GitHub Actions output THEN the test SHALL verify the correct annotation format
5. WHEN a test checks human-readable output THEN the test SHALL verify the presence of expected text and formatting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test names to accurately reflect what the test actually does, so that I can understand the test purpose and maintain the code effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test is named test_discover_files_from_stdin THEN the test SHALL actually test stdin functionality OR be renamed to reflect its actual behavior
2. WHEN a test is named test_check_large_file_with_errors THEN the test SHALL actually test large file error scenarios OR be renamed appropriately
3. WHEN a test is named test_check_streaming_seek_error THEN the test SHALL actually test seek error scenarios OR be renamed appropriately
4. WHEN a test is named test_check_streaming_read_error THEN the test SHALL actually test read error scenarios OR be renamed appropriately
5. WHEN a test is named test_discover_files_directory_entry_error THEN the test SHALL actually test directory entry errors OR be removed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to be free of unused code and variables, so that the test code is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test creates variables THEN all variables SHALL be used in meaningful assertions
2. WHEN a test has commented code suggesting specific behavior THEN the test SHALL implement that behavior OR remove the misleading comments
3. WHEN a test has setup code for scenarios THEN the setup code SHALL be relevant to what is actually being tested
4. WHEN a test creates large files or complex data THEN that data SHALL be used in the actual test logic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests to properly test the intended functionality, so that I can verify end-to-end behavior works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing stdin functionality THEN the test SHALL create temporary files and pass their paths via stdin
2. WHEN testing exit codes THEN the test SHALL verify the specific exit code values match expected behavior
3. WHEN testing file processing THEN the test SHALL use actual files that exist in the test environment
4. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the test SHALL create scenarios that actually trigger those error conditions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration tests to have meaningful assertions, so that I can verify configuration loading behavior is correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing configuration loading THEN the test SHALL assert specific expected outcomes (success or failure)
2. WHEN testing unknown configuration fields THEN the test SHALL verify the expected behavior (ignore or error)
3. WHEN testing invalid configuration syntax THEN the test SHALL assert that an error occurs
4. WHEN testing configuration edge cases THEN the test SHALL verify the specific behavior rather than using tautological assertions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file formatting to follow standard conventions, so that the codebase maintains consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is created or modified THEN the file SHALL end with a newline character
2. WHEN documentation files are updated THEN they SHALL follow standard formatting conventions
3. WHEN code files are modified THEN they SHALL pass formatting checks
